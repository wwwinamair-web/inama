# Archive of Truth

A decentralized, AI-powered archive of censored & forgotten knowledge — preserved forever, accessible to all.

## 🌍 Why this exists
Governments rewrite history. Corporations suppress health data. Media narrows the narrative.  
This archive restores what’s been hidden — not as opinion, but as **verifiable evidence** from public sources:
- Declassified political documents (CIA FOIA, National Archives)
- Peer-reviewed medical studies ignored due to industry pressure
- Public health data withheld from citizens (air/water quality, drug risks)
- Historical records erased from school textbooks worldwide

All content is sourced, timestamped, and never altered.

## 🤖 How AI helps
We use **open-source AI models** (Llama, Mistral, NLLB) to:
- Translate knowledge into 100+ languages — including rare & indigenous ones
- Summarize 100-page reports into 30-second insights
- Enable private Q&A using only archived, verified sources
- Build offline-first apps for low-connectivity regions

No commercial APIs. No user tracking. No data collection.

## 🔒 Our commitments
- ✅ **100% open-source** — all code on GitHub  
- ✅ **Zero personal use** — all donations fund storage & compute  
- ✅ **Monthly public expense reports**  
- ✅ **Permanent preservation** on Arweave & IPFS  
- ✅ **MIT Licensed** — free for anyone to use, share, or improve
